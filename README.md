**Authors**: Abba Davide, Aloscari Sebastiano, Catalini Riccardo

The Soccer Vision project applies event captioning methods to soccer matches, aiming to understand and analyze match situations by videos. Leveraging advanced deep learning techniques and geometry considerations the project provides valuable insights for coaches, analysts, and soccer academies.

### Objectives
- Analyze soccer match situations and events using computer vision.
- Provide coaches with insights into team tactics and strategies.
- Enhance player training based on opponent teams analysis.
- Facilitate match analysis and decision-making processes.

### Key Features
- Automated event captioning using YOLOv5.
- Detection of players, referee, ball, and key events (corner, penalties, etc.).
- Recognition of the shot type.
